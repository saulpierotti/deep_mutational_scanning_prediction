  abstract        = {All proteins undergo a dramatic change in their dynamical properties at approximately 200 K. Above this temperature, their dynamic behavior is dominated by large-scale collective motions of bonded and nonbonded groups of atoms. At lower temperatures, simple harmonic vibrations predominate. The transition has been described as a 'glass transition' to emphasize certain similarities between the change in dynamic behavior of individual protein molecules and the changes in viscosity and other properties of liquids when they form a glass. The glass transition may reflect the intrinsic temperature dependence of the motions of atoms in the protein itself, in the bound solvent on the surface of the protein, or it may reflect contributions from both. Protein function is significantly altered below this transition temperature; a fact that can be exploited to trap normally unstable intermediates in enzyme-catalyzed reactions and stabilize them for periods long enough to permit their characterization by high-resolution protein crystallography.},

In addition to these practical considerations, the agreement of our sequence-based calculations with experimental data for both structure and stability demonstrates a strong relation between the statistical distribution of protein sequences produced by natural evolutionary processes, and the thermodynamic stability of the structures to which these sequences fold.},

Machine learning methods attempt to build models that capture some element of interest based on given data. Most common learning algorithms feature a set of hyperparameters that must be determined before training commences. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the resulting model's performance, but determining good values can be complex; hence a disciplined, theoretically sound search strategy is essential.},
